## Automated Web Security Analysis Tool
### CS 6727 Practicum Project

#### Problem Statement:
This practicum project proposes to develop an automated web security analysis tool that can intelligently scan webpages, identify potential security vulnerabilities, and generate comprehensive reports with actionable insights. The tool will focus on analyzing input fields, links, and other web elements to uncover threats such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and various other common web application vulnerabilities.

#### Motivation:
The importance of web security cannot be overstated, considering the increasing frequency and sophistication of cyber threats targeting web applications. Traditional security tools often require a significant level of expertise, limiting their accessibility to individuals without a strong security background. This project aims to bridge this gap by developing a tool that empowers non-security professionals, such as QAs and developers, to efficiently understand and test vulnerabilities. By providing detailed reports, sample payloads, and reference study links, the tool will enable users to enhance the security posture of their web applications without requiring in-depth security knowledge.

This initiative is crucial in a real-world context where web applications play a central role in various domains. Security incidents can have severe consequences, including data breaches, financial losses, and damage to an organization's reputation. By creating a tool that is user-friendly and approachable, we aim to democratize web security and empower a broader audience to contribute to the protection of online assets.

#### Expected Deliverables:

1.	Automated Web Security Analysis Tool:
•	A functional tool capable of scanning webpages for common vulnerabilities.
•	The tool should intelligently identify input fields, links, and potential threat vectors.

2.	Comprehensive Vulnerability Reports:
•	Detailed reports for each identified vulnerability, including risk severity ratings, affected components, and recommended remediation steps.
•	Payload examples and proofs of concept to assist engineers in testing and validating vulnerabilities.

3.	User-Friendly Interface:
•	An intuitive user interface that allows users to easily input a webpage and receive clear, actionable reports.
•	The tool should be designed with simplicity in mind to cater to individuals without extensive security backgrounds.

4.	Educational Resources:
•	Inclusion of reference study links within the reports to educate users on the nature of each vulnerability.
•	The tool would provide guidance and best practices for secure coding to enhance user understanding.

5.	Testing and Validation:
•	Incorporation of a testing mechanism to validate the accuracy and effectiveness of the tool across various web applications and browsers.
